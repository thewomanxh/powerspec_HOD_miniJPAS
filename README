These codes are to calculate Auto correlation power spectrum for miniJPAS based HOD.


** <powerspec_HOD> stores functions those to compute window function, number density, power spectrum from measurement and theory.
** <param_fac> stores parameters, which can be modified.
** <read_miniJPAS_cl> is to build input data for powerspec_HOD.
** <read_miniJPAS_autodata> is to select data from the original one.

You can run MCMC with the functions in powerspec_HOD to find the HOD parameters.
